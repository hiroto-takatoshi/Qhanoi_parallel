# Qhanoi_parallel
hanoi tower problem in Q learning (parallel version)

Base code credit to : https://github.com/khpeek/Q-learning-Hanoi/blob/master/hanoi.py

Parallel version inspired by:

Kretchmar, R. Matthew. "Parallel reinforcement learning." The 6th World Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics. 2002.

The implemention is a dumb version, time complexity is somehow huge.
